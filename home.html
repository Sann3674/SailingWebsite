                    <p>Little Scarlet is a 32 foot long sailing yacht that was built in 1987 by Sadler Yachts in Poole,
                        Dorset. She is one of around 300 Sadler 32’s that were built between 1979 and 1989 and her
                        design is very typical of that era. She was designed to perform well within the racing handicap
                        systems of the period and so has a wide beam, canoe-like stern and very small transom; elegant
                        lines that are a stark contrast to the more ‘boxy’ shape of modern yachts but gave her good
                        speed in relation to her length. On the downside Little Scarlet does not have the spacious
                        accommodation that is expected in modern yachts but we like to think that sailing performance
                        and good looks are more important than home comforts – if we wanted double beds we would have
                        stayed at home! <br><br>
                        Her rig is simple. She has a single mast that extends approximately 40 feet (12.12m) from the
                        deck and in most conditions two sails will be set – a main sail behind the mast and a larger
                        sail known as a genoa that unfurls from the bow and overlaps with the mast and main sail. With
                        these two sails set Little Scarlet should be able to sail at almost any angle to the wind except
                        when the within 25 degrees of the wind ‘on the nose or bow’. <br><br>On days when there is no
                        wind or if
                        we need to go exactly where the wind is coming from or perhaps we are just fed up with sailing
                        (!) we have a diesel engine that will drive us along at around 6 knots and uses
                        around 2 litres an hour or, in old fashioned motoring terms – around 14 miles per gallon. With
                        our tank full that gives us a range of around 200 miles. Detailed specifications for the Sadler
                        32 as built (and Little Scarlet is pretty original!) are available here -

                    <p>David and Nigel met a very long time ago, or, as Nigel would say “when the sky was full of
                        bi-planes”. In fact, they were both fortunate to be appointed to the Hong Squadron in the early
                        1980’s as very junior Royal Naval officers. David was Gunnery Officer of HM Ships WASPERTON and
                        WOLVERTON (not both at the same time!) and Nigel navigated HMS SWALLOW, one of the ‘new’ Hong
                        Kong Patrol ships that replaced the elderly converted ’Ton’ class minesweepers.<br><br>
                        Shared accommodation on the 25th floor of Prince of Wales building, HMS TAMAR, the Navy’s shore
                        base in Hong Kong, combined with a common interest in the Rolling Stones, HK nightlife and Tsing
                        Tao beer laid the foundation of a friendship that has continued through a mutual interest in
                        sailing.<br><br>
                        Nigel’s sailing log-book includes extensive cruising around European waters but racing in the
                        South China Sea and across the Pacific (San Francisco to Hawaii) reflect a career that, in
                        addition to Hong Kong, has included appointments in Singapore and Hawaii (some people are better
                        than others at planning their career paths!) Most of David’s sailing has been restricted to the
                        cooler and greyer waters of the Solent, much of it in the beautiful Portsmouth based Victory
                        Class keelboats Z1, Woozle and Z54, Zelia. Over the last few years he has been a committee
                        member at Portsmouth Sailing Club, focused on supporting all forms of boating but particularly
                        the Spring and Autumn Spithead Racing Series.</p>
