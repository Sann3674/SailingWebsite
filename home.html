                    <p>Little Scarlet is a 32 foot long sailing yacht that was built in 1987 by Sadler Yachts in Poole,
                        Dorset. She is one of around 300 Sadler 32’s that were built between 1979 and 1989 and her
                        design is very typical of that era. She was designed to perform well within the racing handicap
                        systems of the period and so has a wide beam, canoe-like stern and very small transom; elegant
                        lines that are a stark contrast to the more ‘boxy’ shape of modern yachts but gave her good
                        speed in relation to her length. On the downside Little Scarlet does not have the spacious
                        accommodation that is expected in modern yachts but we like to think that sailing performance
                        and good looks are more important than home comforts – if we wanted double beds we would have
                        stayed at home! <br><br>
                        Her rig is simple. She has a single mast that extends approximately 40 feet (12.12m) from the
                        deck and in most conditions two sails will be set – a main sail behind the mast and a larger
                        sail known as a genoa that unfurls from the bow and overlaps with the mast and main sail. With
                        these two sails set Little Scarlet should be able to sail at almost any angle to the wind except
                        when the within 25 degrees of the wind ‘on the nose or bow’. <br><br>On days when there is no
                        wind or if
                        we need to go exactly where the wind is coming from or perhaps we are just fed up with sailing
                        (!) we have a diesel engine that will drive us along at around 6 knots and uses
                        around 2 litres an hour or, in old fashioned motoring terms – around 14 miles per gallon. With
                        our tank full that gives us a range of around 200 miles. Detailed specifications for the Sadler
                        32 as built (and Little Scarlet is pretty original!) are available here -

                        <br><br>We will add more pictures of Little Scarlet as our voyage progresses!

                <div class="pl-2 ml-2 rob-copy">
                    <p>Born in Kilkea, County Kildare, Ireland, Shackleton and his Anglo-Irish family[1] moved to
                        Sydenham in suburban south London when he was ten. Shackleton's first experience of the polar
                        regions was as third officer on Captain Robert Falcon Scott's Discovery expedition of 1901–1904,
                        from which he was sent home early on health grounds, after he and his companions Scott and
                        Edward Adrian Wilson set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82°S. <br><br>

                        After the race to the South Pole ended in December 1911, with Roald Amundsen's conquest,
                        Shackleton turned his attention to the crossing of Antarctica from sea to sea, via the pole. To
                        this end, he made preparations for what became the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition,
                        1914–1917. Disaster struck this expedition when its ship, Endurance, became trapped in pack ice
                        and was slowly crushed before the shore parties could be landed. The crew escaped by camping on
                        the sea ice until it disintegrated, then by launching the lifeboats to reach Elephant Island and
                        ultimately South Georgia Island, a stormy ocean voyage of 720 nautical miles (1,330 km; 830 mi)
                        and Shackleton's most famous exploit. In 1921, he returned to the Antarctic with the
                        Shackleton–Rowett Expedition, but died of a heart attack while his ship was moored in South
                        Georgia. At his wife's request, he was buried there</p>
