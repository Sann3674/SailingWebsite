                            systems that allow water to pass through the hull: in, to allow engine sea water cooling and
                            heads (toilet!) flushing and out, from the sinks, cockpit drains and heads.

                            north was to invest in a heater, both for personal comfort and to keep kit nice and dry.
                            At some stage in the past Little Scarlet was fitted with a gas heater but it had not been
                            serviceable for many years however it made sense to incorporate the existing ducting within
                            the set-up for the new, replacement system.

                            going to be a busier winter than usual as she is prepared for a nice long sail around UK
                            next year.
                            Little Scarlet is a well set-up yacht that has largely been used for Solent cruising but
                            there are a range of upgrades that we intend to make to set her up for extended sailing and
                            living onboard.

                            design is very typical of that era. </p>
