            <p>We were up early this morning – tough after yesterday’s gruelling passage, but we really wanted to get
                ashore, see a little of Aran and then get away in time to make the lock gate entrance at Galway – it
                closes at 1700.</p>
            <p>We were on a buoy which meant that we had to get out Terry the tender (he’s heavy!) inflate him, lower
                over the side and fit the outboard. Not really a big deal but hard work early in the morning and I was
                really wondering whether it was going to be worth all the effort. My doubts increased when we got ashore
                and discovered that the most straightforward way of seeing the ancient fort Dun Aonghusa (the main site
                on the island) was to hire bikes and cycle.</p>
            <p>But cycle we did and the fort was stunning – set high on massive cliffs but the whole landscape was
                equally interesting – lots of bare rocks, tiny stone walled fields battered by the Atlantic weather.</p>
            <p>We cycled for a couple of hours, bought some milk and ice in the supermarket and headed back to Little
                Scarlet just as hundreds of day trippers were arriving by ferry. With Terry quickly deflated and stowed
                we were on our way by midday towards Galway. </p>
            <p>Facilities for visiting yachts were not guaranteed in Galway – there is a small harbour enclosed behind a
                lock that only opens for a couple of hours before high water and a visitors buoy or two but we were
                slightly concerned we might not find a berth. Within an hour of the harbour we called the harbour master
                by VHF – no answer, we called their phone number it being a Saturday there was only an ‘out of office’
                message so we pressed on and arriving at 1630 the lock was open so we entered. It was a small harbour
                basin with commecial shipping one side and yachts the other. </p>
            <p>We turned towards the yachts and saw a man working on his beautiful wooden yacht – shiuting to him we
                asked him if there were any visitors berths available – his response was ‘berth here’ alongside me’ – so
                we did! We were very lucky; there were not any other obvious spaces and we would have had to leave the
                harbour and moor to a buoy outside but now were alongside, able to walk ashore without using Terry The
                Tender. Our new neighbour was Swiss, he had brought the boat and his young family from France and was
                spending some time in Ireland while his partner attended Galway University, his children attended school
                locally and he ‘worked from his boat’.</p>
            <p>The ‘run- ashore’ in Galway was dominated by the Champions League Final! Every pub seemed to be full of
                Irish Liverpool supporters or hen parties! First impressions of Galway were that it is clearly a
                ‘party-town’; there was a lot of drinking and large groups of people out and about but the atmosphere
                was very cheerful – I’m sure there are many exceptions but (stereotyping warning!) the Irish seem to be
                ‘happy drinkers’!</p>
