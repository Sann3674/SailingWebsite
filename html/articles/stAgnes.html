            <p>After our walk around St Mary’s yesterday we did a little research and felt that a visit to the most
                South Westerly pub in the UK, on the island of St Agnes, was appropriate but first we needed to ensure
                we were topped up with fuel and water. We had plenty for a few days in and around the Scillies but we
                had a long passage, probably to Ireland to consider and it made sense to top up before we left the
                islands.</p>
            <p>Fuel and water was available at the town jetty but unfortunately it was busy with ferries and commercial
                vessels so after some prevarication I decided to give up and head straight to St Agnes (about an hour
                away) and get fuel and water the following day in Tresco, an adjacent island. </p>
            <p>We anchored just off the Turk’s Head pub, settled down nicely with a cup of tea when I then realised that
                fuel would actually not be available at Tresco the following day, Nigel had told me earlier but I
                clearly wasn’t listening! It was St Mary’s or nothing so back we went and found a spot to berth on the
                wall. There was a fresh breeze blowing us onto the wall which was uncomfortable for a fibre glass yacht
                so I felt very smug to be able to use my previously prepared ‘fender-board’ (see picture!) to provide
                some protection. Unfortunately, the water hydrant was broken but with our jerry cans refilled with
                diesel and rubbish ditched in the bin we headed back to the anchorage, unfortunately losing a fender
                which we gave up for lost for fear of being blown back against the wall. All day we had been towing
                Terry the tender and it was enroute back to the anchorage that we noticed that Terry was doing a good
                impression of a submarine – we quickly stopped and some vigorous bailing with a bucket ensured that both
                tender and outboard engine stayed afloat. </p>
            <p>Back at St Agnes we anchored, Nigel went off for a walk and I worried about whether we were securely
                anchored or would drift onto the rocks. </p>
            <p>That evening we had a good meal in the Turks Head (we were able to keep an eye on Little Scarlet from the
                pub!) and we found an HMS HECLA crest next to the bar – I was a Midshipman onboard during the Falklands
                conflict.</p>
            <p>We returned back on board well fed and watered but my nagging doubts about the anchorage led to a broken
                night and lots of meerkat impressions as I stuck my hear out to check our position.</p>
