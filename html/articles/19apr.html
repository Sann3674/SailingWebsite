            <p>I moved Little Scarlet from her usual berth at Whale Island last night and brought her down to the
                Portsmouth SC pontoon in the Camber, Old Portsmouth. It was a bit of a squeeze getting in as many of the
                Victory Class (<a href="https://victoryclass.org.uk/" target="_blank">www.victoryclass.org.uk</a>) had
                been busy all weekend launching ready for season and unusually
                several were on the pontoons overnight ‘taking up’ and awaiting masts etc. </p>
            <p>Anyway - Little Scarlet is on the pontoon which makes access extremely easy; particularly useful for the
                electronics engineer Sean from Greenham Regis (<a href="http://www.greenham-regis.com/"
                    target="_blank">www.greenham-regis.com</a>) who is currently
                fitting a Raymarine chart-plotter and AIS transmit and receive system. I’ll say more about the
                electronics over the next few weeks but the fit seems to be going well so far so we should be able to
                sail on time tomorrow with everything working... I’ve deployed in a few HM ships in the past with
                contractors still installing equipment but Sean’s not keen to sail with us so fingers crossed!</p>
            <p>I’ve been spending most of the day wondering what I may have forgotten. We have a full tank of diesel
                which I reckon will give us a range of around 200 miles and we’ve stowed away several full jerry cans
                just in case .. I’m also wondering if we’ve enough gas for our cooker, especially as there has been a
                shortage (all those camping stay-cations!) – We have extra cylinders stowed away in our anchor locker
                where there is good ventilation and drainage for any stray gas. </p>
            <p>Nigel has taken on the ‘victualling’ responsibilities so we will have plenty of food to keep us going for
                the first few days and we have a huge box of chilli con carne -thank you Marianne! We don’t have a
                refrigerator so we are slightly limited with the fresh goods we can carry but hopefully we will have
                opportunities to ‘re-store’ every few days. We do have a very well stocked beef, wine and spirits
                ‘store’ too!</p>
            <p>My last visit to the chandlery included a purchase of leak sealant and a guide to basic diesel engines -
                an indication of my concern with an irritating water leak through the deck into the cabin and my
                ignorance of diesel engines, ours has been very reliable but …</p>
            <p>So I think we are as ready as we'll ever be. The weather forecast has been looking extremely good with a
                consistently easterly breeze; perfect to help us on our way to the west and if we get away at midday
                tomorrow we will have the benefit of a strong Spring ebb tide all the way down the Solent and past the
                Needles.</p>
            <p>And …  there was time for a quick ‘pre-deployment’ from haircut - thanks Hannah! <a href="https://www.hannahhairuk.com/" target="_blank">www.hannahhair.co.uk</a>
