            <p>We had had several recommendations to visit the island of Inishbofin. We were told it is a beautiful and
                safe anchorage and we had also heard that it might be the site of the westernmost pub in Ireland so we
                felt it deserved a visit. It was also handily located along our intended route north!</p>
            <p>The forecast for the passage was for gentle North-westerly winds, not ideal as we would be heading north
                but, we felt, achievable motor-sailing. With the main sail hoisted and the engine driving we headed
                west, past the Aran Islands and then north west towards Inishbofin in increasingly unpleasant and lumpy
                seas. After several hours we discussed the option of diverting into an anchorage at Roundstone but
                decided to keep plugging on. </p>
            <p>With an 0530 ‘Call the Hands’ and departure from Galway at 0600 we were pretty tired by the time we
                arrived in Bofin Harbour at 2030. The entry into the harbour is not particularly difficult with lights
                and white painted ‘leading’ beacons to assist but it is extremely narrow, opening into a lovely
                protected anchorage with a ruined Cromwellian fort one side and the small village and port of Inishbofin
                opposite.</p>
            <p>There were two other yachts at anchor; both significantly larger and smarter than Little Scarlet but we
                found room beyond them and anchored for the night in around two and a half metres of water. </p>
            <p>The wind had eased and the anchorage was extremely calm so although we frequently checked that the anchor
                was holding and we were not dragging (I also had an anchor alarm ‘app’ set on my mobile) it was an
                extremely pleasant and quiet night.</p>
            <p>The following morning the other two yachts left leaving us with just a couple of fishing boats for
                company. We inflated and launched Terry and headed ashore to explore and hopefully buy more fuel. We
                discovered that a fuel bowser visited the island once a week but not while we were there so we headed
                off for a walk and look around the island. The island was quiet but clearly preparing for the
                forthcoming summer season. It is a popular destination for walkers, nature lovers and those looking for
                a little peace although we were told that it was very busy last year as a result of the COVID
                restrictions on foreign travel. We think we found the westernmost pub in Ireland, a peat bog, a Mohican
                sheep and a fishing boat that appeared to have had some navigational issues!</p>
            <p>We also had an interesting evening pursuing a source of fuel. To cut a long story short the ferry crew
                were extremely helpful and we were able to leave Inishbofin fully replenished, a good feeling. </p>
