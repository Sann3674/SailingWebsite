            <p>Nigel re-joined Little Scarlet last night and we took the opportunity to have a ‘run-ashore’ in Cork
                City. It was busy out there... Getting food after about 9pm seemed difficult so we ended up in the queue
                for an apparently iconic Hillbilly’s ‘Breast In A Bun’ (<a href="https://www.hillbillys.ie/?l=en"
                    target="_blank">www.hillbillys.ie</a>) It was very good! So we’ve
                been introduced to two new delicacies – Cabbage and Bacon in Waterford and Breast in a Bun here in Cork
                – wonder what’s next?!</p>
            <p>Our berth in Cork City was just under the old Customs House; close to the pubs, clubs and Aldi which was
                handy for a big shop this morning. The Customs House buildings and adjacent warehouses had clearly been
                grand buildings ‘in their day’ but were now looking rather neglected. We believe there is a plan for
                them to be developed into a hotel which could be very impressive. </p>
            <p>We liked Cork – there seemed to be a strong, cosmopolitan and young feel about the city, possibly the
                influence of the university or just that we were out on a Saturday night!</p>
            <p>After a great breakfast in a very smart New York diner style cafe we headed off back down Cork Harbour,
                passing Monkstown and Cobh (with a huge cruise ship alongside) before arriving at the Royal Cork Yacht
                Club in Crosshaven.</p>
            <p>We called the Royal Cork by radio asking for a visitors berth – they had one available but it was tucked
                in behind a rather large yacht and required us to approach with the wind and very strong tidal stream
                behind us.. It was an interesting manoeuvre that we would not have achieved without some assistance from
                the large yacht’s crew who tended our lines and ensured we didn’t touch then or anybody else.. It might
                have been wiser for us to wait for the tide to slacken off before berthing – we’ll know next time!</p>
            <p>As might be expected the Royal Cork YC was extremely pleasant and comfortable but the highlight for us
                was the laundry facilities!</p>
            <p>The village of Crosshaven was quiet (to be fair it was a Sunday night) but we found another colourful pub
                for some drink and craic and then take away fish and chips – evening food seemed difficult to find!</p>
