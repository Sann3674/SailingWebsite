            <p>We arrived in Kinsale yesterday afternoon after a slightly choppy but lovely sunny sail down the coast
                from Cork harbour. No doubt we shall be saying this again but this coastline is spectacular with some
                really interesting rock formations. </p>
            <p>As we arrived off Kinsale we sailed between two small rocky islands – Big and Little Sovereigns – and
                then into the beautiful estuary of Kinsale. We were recommended to berth at the Kinsale Yacht club and
                it was good advice. We were offered a berth on the outboard side of the marina and tucked in amongst
                several other visiting yachts who, like us, had seen the forecast for the next few days and were ‘holed
                up’ waiting for the strong south-westerlies to abate. Amongst the visitors it was great to see Avocette
                of Portsmouth, a proper ocean-going yacht that was previously owned by fellow Portsmouth Sailing Club
                member, Chris Smith. Avocette is also planning to head west about around Ireland so we may well see her
                again.</p>
            <p>Kinsale is a lovely busy town that reminds me of some of the estuary ports along the Devon and Cornwall
                coast. It is clearly popular with tourists exploring the coast (The Wild Atlantic Way) but also a
                popular spot for second home owners who perhaps enjoy the local sailing or golf at the Old Head Golf
                Links – a world renowned course situated up on the cliffs on the Old Head of Kinsale – a major headland
                just to the south west of the town. </p>
            <p>We have had the opportunity to have a good wander around and learn a little about the history here. I had
                no idea that the Spanish aligned with the Irish to fight the English here at the Battle of Kinsale in
                1601, it ended in victory for the English and was the ultimate battle in England’s conquest of Gaelic
                Ireland. Kinsale is also the location of Charles Fort, a massive star shaped fort built in the late 17th
                century with spectaclar views over kinsale harbour nd a good walk from the yacht club! </p>
            <p>Although we have been enjoying Kinsale we have been rather occupied with weather forecasts and when we
                might be able to get away to the west, towards Dingle, Bantry Bay and Dingle. A key consideration for us
                is that there are not many marinas aloing the coast and we will need to rely on anchoring and mooring
                buoys, both options that are fine in fair weather but not very attractive in the fresh south westerlies
                that seem to be forecast every other day over the next few days! We are keen to ‘press on’ but don’t
                want to be battling into the sea and weather, especially if we don’t have a settled night of rest ahead!
            </p>
            <p>It is looking likely that we will try to use a break in the weather on Thursday to make for Glandore;
                there are apparently visitors buoys there that we can use and we will be a little futher along our
                intended path but it might mean that we have a fairly grim day beating into some seas that are likely to
                be quite rough after a couiple of days of strong south westerly breeze. </p>
