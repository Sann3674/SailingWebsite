            <p>Little Scarlet is a 32 foot long sailing yacht that was built in 1987 by Sadler Yachts in Poole,
                Dorset. She is one of around 300 Sadler 32’s that were built between 1979 and 1989 and her
                design is very typical of that era. She was designed to perform well within the racing handicap
                systems of the period and so has a wide beam, canoe-like stern and very small transom; elegant
                lines that are a stark contrast to the more ‘boxy’ shape of modern yachts but gave her good
                speed in relation to her length. On the downside Little Scarlet does not have the spacious
                accommodation that is expected in modern yachts but we like to think that sailing performance
                and good looks are more important than home comforts – if we wanted double beds we would have
                stayed at home!</p>
            <p>
                Her rig is simple. She has a single mast that extends approximately 40 feet (12.12m) from the
                deck and in most conditions two sails will be set – a main sail behind the mast and a larger
                sail known as a genoa that unfurls from the bow and overlaps with the mast and main sail. With
                these two sails set Little Scarlet should be able to sail at almost any angle to the wind except
                when the within 25 degrees of the wind ‘on the nose or bow’.</p>
            <p>On days when there is no
                wind or if
                we need to go exactly where the wind is coming from or perhaps we are just fed up with sailing
                (!) we have a diesel engine that will drive us along at around 6 knots and uses
                around 2 litres an hour or, in old fashioned motoring terms – around 14 miles per gallon. With
                our tank full that gives us a range of around 200 miles. Detailed specifications for the Sadler
                32 as built (and Little Scarlet is pretty original!) are available here -
