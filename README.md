# Sailing website

A website to help monitor my Dad's progress on his sailing trip around the UK.

## What will the software do?  

* Descriptive page on dad & boat - what is dad planning on doing?  This is a static page
* Monitor where he is on the journey - doing this on a map would be very cool (place & date he was there)
* Allow you to post good luck messages / advice messages
* Blog page where he can post updates and pictures
