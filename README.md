A website to help monitor my Dad's progress on his sailing trip around the UK.

## What will the software do?  

* ~~Descriptive page on the crewe & boat - and background to the trip~~
* Monitor where boat is on the journey 
* Allow you to post good luck messages / advice messages
* ~~Blog page where he can post updates and pictures~~
* ~~Have a trivia page to test sailing knowledge~~
